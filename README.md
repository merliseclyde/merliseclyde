- 👋 Hi, I’m @merliseclyde !  I am a professor at Duke University in the the Department of Statistical Science.
- 👀 I’m interested in Bayesian Statistics, in particular, methods for addressing Bayesian model uncertainty and Bayesian non-parametric regression.
- 💞️ I’m interested in collaborating on packages so let me know if you are interested in contributing to the R package `BAS` or `bark`
- 📫 If you encounter an issue with any of my `R` packages please report an issue here on GitHub rather than emailing me!
